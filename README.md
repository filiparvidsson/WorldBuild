# Some physics
Here's some physics we'll use for the planet

The mass of a planet is calculated using Newtons law of gravity:
a = (G*M)/(r2)

or make and assumption of earth's density times the volume:
#### Eath
- Earth desnity: 5.51g/cm3 which emaculates to 5510kg/m3
- Earth has a radius of 6 371 000m

The rotation of the earth is around 464m/s at the equator
If we want to keep this value a constant we need to keep it that way.
When radius goes up, rotation must go down.

Now, it spins 1 degree per second, meaning 360 seconds is one day.
- The number of seconds in a day is 86 400.
- The day goes 240 times faster at the moment

- Rotation coefficient = 

#### Moon
And for the moon
- Moon density: 3340kg/m3
- Moon radius: 1 737 400m

- The volume of a sphere is calculated by 0.75*pi*r^3


The time a orbit takes is calculated by:
T^2 = ((4*pi^2)/G(M+m)) * r^3

- G is the gravitational constant
- M is the mass of the planet
- m is the mass of the moon
